#### Alcohol_Sales_Prediction
1. Introduction: There has always been a need by the business owners to know the demand for their products. This benefits the whole business model as it stockpiles the revenue. This improved model deals with the prediction of the consumption of different alcoholic beverages. Based on liquor sales data, various Machine Learning algorithms are applied for enhancing the accuracy of the prediction. The risk of entering a new market can also be minimized by using this model. It is built in a robust way that can be implemented around various fields for improved accuracy in prediction models. We will be using the open-source dataset which is provided by <b> Alcoholic Beverages Division of IOWA Department of Commerce for liquor sales prediction </b>

2. Dataset Selection
There are lots of different datasets available for alcohol sales prediction. In this research, we have used the dataset which is provided by Iowa Department of Commerce, Alcoholic Beverages Division. Please find the link below:
<a href="https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/2019-Iowa-Liquor-Sales/38x4-vs5h">https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/2019-Iowa-Liquor-Sales/38x4-vs5h</a>
The dataset size is 549MB with 2.38M million rows and 24 columns. The columns of the datasets are as follows:
<li>Invoice/Item Number: The unique invoice number.
Date: The date of liquor purchased or sold. 
Store Number: The store number of the liquor shop.
Store Name: The store name of the liquor shop.
Address: The store address of the liquor shop.
City: City of the liquor shop.
Zip Code: Zip code of the city.
Store Location: Liquor store location. 
County Number: The number of counties.
County: The county of the liquor sold.
Category: Category of the liquor.
Category Name: Category name of the liquor.
Vendor Number: Vendor number who sold the liquor.
Vendor Name: Vendor name who sold the liquor.
Item Number: Unique item number for liquor.
Item Description: Liquor description.
Pack: The pack sold out.
Bottle Volume (ml): The volume of liquor bottles sold in a milliliter. 
State Bottle Cost: The cost of the bottle at the state level. 
State Bottle Retail: The cost of the bottle at the retail level.
Bottles Sold: Number of bottles sold. 
Sale (Dollars): Sales of liquors in dollars. 
Volume Sold (Liters): Volume of liquor sold in liters. 
Volume Sold (Gallons): Volume of liquor sold in gallons.</li>


2. Data Preprocessing
Once the dataset is extracted, there were several issues with the data before it can go for further analysis. Data cleaning and transformation according to the proposal needs to be configured. All the rows with null values should be deleted from the data, dropping duplicate rows. Feature extraction should be kept in mind in this stage of KDD. Although the size of the liquor data is huge, but by data preprocessing standards it should be cleaned appropriately so that we can analyze the data accordingly.

3. Data Transformation or Data reduction and projection
In this stage, the data undergoes major changes to suit the goal of the research. Feature extraction is applied in this stage which means only relevant data is chosen for analysis.
