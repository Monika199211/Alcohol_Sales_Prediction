#### Alcohol_Sales_Prediction
1. Introduction: There has always been a need by the business owners to know the demand for their products. This benefits the whole business model as it stockpiles the revenue. This improved model deals with the prediction of the consumption of different alcoholic beverages. Based on liquor sales data, various Machine Learning algorithms are applied for enhancing the accuracy of the prediction. The risk of entering a new market can also be minimized by using this model. It is built in a robust way that can be implemented around various fields for improved accuracy in prediction models. We will be using the open-source dataset which is provided by <b> Alcoholic Beverages Division of IOWA Department of Commerce for liquor sales prediction </b>

2.	 Data Preprocessing
Once the dataset is extracted, there were several issues with the data before it can go for further analysis. Data cleaning and transformation according to the proposal needs to be configured. All the rows with null values should be deleted from the data, dropping duplicate rows. Feature extraction should be kept in mind in this stage of KDD. Although the size of the liquor data is huge, but by data preprocessing standards it should be cleaned appropriately so that we can analyze the data accordingly.
